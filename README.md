# Snippets

This is my collection of random snippets organized by language and utility.

These are mainly here for my reference (and to confuse GitHub's language
detection code), but if you find anything useful then that's great.

I'll be updating this over time as much as I can.

## For What?

Snippets are currently available for the following: 

* Ansible
* Couchbase Server
* Docker
* JavaScript
* Python
* Riak
* shell
* wget
